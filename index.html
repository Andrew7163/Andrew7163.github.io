      I have work experience at Penn State and UPenn working in hydrology and carbon capture trying to figure out ways to combat climate change in communities like the FLordia keys, which are frequently hit by hurricanes that destroy native life. Working at Penn State has taught me alot because coding is required to make data charts comparing biospheric elements over a duration of time.
