      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Andrew Moreland. I am from Philadelphia, I major in environmental engineering at Lincoln University. I want to work on solutions for combating climate change as well as going to different communities so that they can combat climate change. My main objective for doing this is because if we look at charts, many communities and countries that are feeling the effects of global warming are impoverished. So, for me, going to these communities and helping them are critical to saving the planet. From a young age, I have always been interested in the weather because of rising temperatures, and my father being an engineer in the Air Force instilled in me the love of helping people as well as traveling to different countries.
